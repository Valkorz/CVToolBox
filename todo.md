### You can ignore this file, it's just a to-do list so I don't get lost.

TODO:

-> Document percepron in a markdown file
-> fine-tune perceptron for better guesses
-> finish documenting perceptron and rewriting perceptron.c
-> create example usage for perceptron
-> test
-> push and share on LinkedIn

MODELS TO BE IMPLEMENTED:

- Neural Networks (Perceptron, Multilayer Perceptron, Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Generative Neural Networks, AutoEnconders, Transformers);
- Probabilistic/statistic models (Naive Bayes, Hidden Markov, Gaussian Mix, Bayes Networks);
- Supervised Learning (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbors);
- Non-Supervised learning (K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, Principal Component Analysis);
- Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning, Deep Q-Networks, Actor-Critic Methods);
- Semi-Supervised;
- Others (Hopfield, Fuzzy, Deep Belief Networks, Boltzman Machines);
